Overview
This repository contains documentation related to the DriverPass project, including a business requirements document and a system design document. These artifacts showcase the process of system analysis and design for a client in need of a comprehensive driver training solution.

Project Summary
The DriverPass project was undertaken for a client named DriverPass, a company aiming to improve driver training and licensing success rates. The client required a system that could facilitate online driver education, manage driving lesson reservations, and track student progress. The system needed to be accessible on various devices and provide robust security features for different user roles.

Reflection
What did I do particularly well? I particularly excelled in capturing the detailed requirements of the DriverPass system and translating them into a clear and actionable business requirements document. The structured approach I took to understanding and organizing the client's needs ensured that the system design was comprehensive and aligned with their vision.

If I could choose one part of my work to revise, what would I pick? If I could revise one aspect of my work, it would be the initial scheduling component of the project. I would refine the Gantt chart to better account for potential delays and dependencies between tasks. Improving the granularity of the schedule would provide a more realistic timeline and better resource allocation.

How did I interpret the user’s needs and implement them into my system design? I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the interview transcript provided by the client, identifying key functionalities, and ensuring these were reflected in the system's features. This included designing user interfaces that were intuitive and implementing backend processes that met the specific requirements for security, scheduling, and data management. Understanding and prioritizing the user’s needs was crucial for creating a system that not only met the client's expectations but was also user-friendly and scalable.

How do I approach designing software? My approach to designing software is systematic and user-centered. I start by thoroughly understanding the client’s requirements through interviews and documentation. I then create models and diagrams to visualize the system architecture and workflows. In the future, I will continue to use techniques like UML diagramming and will likely incorporate more iterative design processes, such as Agile, to allow for continuous feedback and improvement during development.
